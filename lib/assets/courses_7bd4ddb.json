Performance and mission specifications are given, as well as the engine’s characteristics. The class is divided into teams of three to four students who are guided to develop an airplane that can meet these specifications. Individual team members will specialize in areas such as “performance”, “structure”, “systems”, etc., although all team members should be conversant with each other’s results and methodology. Each week, a representative of each team presents a progress lecture on that team’s efforts, which is discussed and critiqued by the class. Also, the teams meet one-on-one with the professor and tutors to discuss specific design questions. At the end of the course each team will present a verbal and written report of sufficient detail to provide a compelling case for the feasibility of their proposed airplane.

South Asia is a place where many external cultural traditions mixed with indigenous traditions to create new socioeconomic and sociopolitical entities and sequences. While we will examine classic examples of hunter-gatherer groups, early villages, urban settlements, regional polities, and large empires through time, we will also stress the contemporaneity of groups of people with very different lifestyles -- hunter-gatherers participated in trading networks with town and city dwellers, pastoral nomads moved through settled village regions during their annual migrations. The impact of archaeological research on the region today is seen through the politicization of South Asian prehistory and history that has strongly affected both interpretations of the past and modern political events. Cases such as the debate over the identity of the Harappans and the existence of the Aryans will be evaluated from both an archaeological and a political perspective.

Strategic use of technology in all sorts of businesses makes the difference between success and failure for these firms. Wealth creation is a real option for many and the business atmosphere is ready for you! Increasingly, people are seeing the advantages of doing their own thing, in their own way, in their own time. Entrepreneurs can control their own lives, structure their own progress and be accountable for their own success - they can fail, but they can not be fired! After all, engineers are the most capable people to be in the forefront of this drive to the business life of the next century. This course is the first of a series of two dealing with entrepreneurship and management of a small company. It is intended that the student would continue to take the follow up course APS432 as s/he progresses toward the engineering degree. Therefore, it is advisable that the descriptions of both courses be studied prior to deciding to take this one. This is a limited enrolment course. If the number of students electing to take the course exceeds the class size limit, selection of the final group will be made on the basis of the “Entrepreneur’s Test”. There will be a certificate awarded upon the successful completion of both courses attesting to the fact that the student has passed this Entrepreneurial Course Series at the University of Toronto. The course is based on real life issues, not theoretical developments or untried options. Topics covered include: Who is an entrepreneur; Canadian business environment; Acquisitions; Different business types (retail, wholesale, manufacturing, and services); Franchising; Human resources, Leadership, Business law; and many others. Several visitors are invited to provide the student with the opportunity to meet real entrepreneurs. There will be several assignments and a session project. It should be noted that the 5 hours per week would all be used for whatever is needed at the time, so tutorials will not normally happen as the calendar indicates them.","division":"Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering","department":"Cross Disciplinary Programs Office","prerequisites":"","exclusions":"CHE488H1/CIV488H1/ECE488H1/MIE488H1/MSE488H1","level":200,"campus":"UTSG","term":"2015 Fall","breadths":[],"meeting_sections":[{"code":"L0101","instructors":["J Paradi"],"times":[{"day":"THURSDAY","start":18,"end":20,"duration":2,"location":"GB 248"},{"day":"WEDNESDAY","start":18,"end":20,"duration":2,"location":"GB 248"}],"size":42,"enrolment":0},{"code":"T0101","instructors":[],"times":[{"day":"WEDNESDAY","start":20,"end":21,"duration":1,"location":"GB 248"}],"size":42,"enrolment":0}]}

The student considering taking this course would typically plan to pursue a career in small business started by him/herself, or in a family enterprise. The skills acquired, however, are very useful in any business where a graduate might end up in his/her career, without the need for actually being an entrepreneur. Our approach to teaching is based on real-life business experiences and many years of successful practice of “what we preach”. The course contains very little theoretical work or academic approaches. It is designed to familiarise you with the kinds of opportunities (problems) likely to be encountered in an entrepreneurial career. If you really want this lifestyle and are prepared to work hard, we will provide you with the practical knowledge and technical skills required to pursue this kind of career. Topics covered in this course include: Marketing and Sales; Legal issues; Financing the business; Human Resources challenges, the Business Plan and many other issues. Note that the course material may be adjusted between the two courses as required. We recognize the value of communication skills in both the classroom and in project reports. In fact, we require that you learn how to present yourself in a business-like manner. As and when appropriate, outside visitors from the business community will join in and contribute to the class discussions. The course deals with practical concepts, actual past and current events and is presented from the point of view of someone who has “done it all”. This means that what you hear is the real stuff. There will be several assignments and the preparation of a full Business Plan as the session project. It should be noted that the 5 hours per week would all be used for whatever is needed at the time, so tutorials will not normally happen as the calendar indicates them.","division":"Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering","department":"Cross Disciplinary Programs Office","prerequisites":"APS234 - Entrepreneurship and Small Business","exclusions":"CHE488H1/CIV488H1/ECE488H1/MIE488H1/MSE488H1","level":400,"campus":"UTSG","term":"2016 Winter","breadths":[],"meeting_sections":[{"code":"L0101","instructors":["J Paradi","J Paradi"],"times":[{"day":"THURSDAY","start":18,"end":20,"duration":2,"location":"GB 248"},{"day":"WEDNESDAY","start":18,"end":21,"duration":3,"location":"GB 248"}],"size":95,"enrolment":0}]}

Thus, engineering concerns itself with the materials used and forces and laws of nature, and the needs of people. Because of scarcity of resources and constraints at all levels, engineering must be closely associated with economics. It is essential that engineering proposals be evaluated in terms of worth and cost before they are undertaken. In this course we emphasize that an essential prerequisite of a successful engineering application is economic feasibility. Hence, investment proposals are evaluated in terms of economic cost concepts, including break even analysis, cost estimation and time value of money. Effective interest rates, inflation and deflation, depreciation and income tax all affect the viability of an investment. Successful engineering projects are chosen from valid alternatives considering such issues as buy or lease, make or buy, cost and benefits and financing alternatives. Both public sector and for-profit examples are used to illustrate the applicability of these rules and approaches.","division":"Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering","department":"Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry","prerequisites":"","exclusions":"","level":200,"campus":"UTSG","term":"2015 Fall","breadths":[],"meeting_sections":[{"code":"L0101","instructors":["A Chan"],"times":[{"day":"FRIDAY","start":10,"end":12,"duration":2,"location":"SF 1101"},{"day":"TUESDAY","start":10,"end":11,"duration":1,"location":"SF 1101"}],"size":180,"enrolment":0},{"code":"T0101","instructors":["A Chan"],"times":[{"day":"MONDAY","start":10,"end":11,"duration":1,"location":"GB 404"},{"day":"MONDAY","start":10,"end":11,"duration":1,"location":"GB 412"},{"day":"MONDAY","start":10,"end":11,"duration":1,"location":"WB 342"}],"size":180,"enrolment":0}]}

We will visit the industrial districts of Italy and study how knowledge diffuses among firms located near each other, and the implications for local productivity and innovation. We will study how British and Canadian local labor markets are affected by the fact that certain industries and occupations are dying. We will travel to Africa, and discuss the extent to which investment from Asia serves to catalyze economic development in Ethiopia's regional economies.

The design projects in Praxis II are both identified and defined by the students themselves, and focus on issues associated with the City of Toronto, its agencies and services, and its communities and citizens. In the first half of the course students, working in small teams, identify, frame, and document appropriate engineering challenges; in the second half they design, prototype, and present engineering solutions to a subset of those identified challenges. In support of these activities students continue to explore in greater depth the theories, tools, and practices of engineering design and communication. Praxis II culminates in an open showcase where students present their design solutions to representatives from interested governmental and non-governmental agencies, to their project stakeholders, and to the general public.","division":"Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering","department":"Division of Engineering Science","prerequisites":"ESC101H1","exclusions":"APS112H1","level":100,"campus":"UTSG","term":"2016 Winter","breadths":[],"meeting_sections":[{"code":"L0101","instructors":["R Irish","J Foster"],"times":[{"day":"MONDAY","start":13,"end":14,"duration":1,"location":"MC 102"},{"day":"THURSDAY","start":17,"end":18,"duration":1,"location":"MC 102"},{"day":"TUESDAY","start":13,"end":14,"duration":1,"location":"MC 102"}],"size":360,"enrolment":0},{"code":"T0101","instructors":[],"times":[{"day":"TUESDAY","start":16,"end":18,"duration":2,"location":"BA 2145"}],"size":27,"enrolment":0},{"code":"T0102","instructors":[],"times":[{"day":"TUESDAY","start":16,"end":18,"duration":2,"location":"BA 2165"}],"size":27,"enrolment":0},{"code":"T0103","instructors":[],"times":[{"day":"TUESDAY","start":16,"end":18,"duration":2,"location":"SF 3201"}],"size":27,"enrolment":0},{"code":"T0104","instructors":[],"times":[{"day":"THURSDAY","start":11,"end":13,"duration":2,"location":"BA 2145"}],"size":36,"enrolment":0},{"code":"T0105","instructors":[],"times":[{"day":"THURSDAY","start":11,"end":13,"duration":2,"location":"BA 2155"}],"size":36,"enrolment":0},{"code":"T0106","instructors":[],"times":[{"day":"THURSDAY","start":11,"end":13,"duration":2,"location":"BA 2165"}],"size":36,"enrolment":0},{"code":"T0107","instructors":[],"times":[{"day":"THURSDAY","start":11,"end":13,"duration":2,"location":"HA 401"}],"size":36,"enrolment":0},{"code":"T0108","instructors":[],"times":[{"day":"WEDNESDAY","start":16,"end":18,"duration":2,"location":"BA 2145"}],"size":27,"enrolment":0},{"code":"T0109","instructors":[],"times":[{"day":"WEDNESDAY","start":16,"end":18,"duration":2,"location":"BA 2155"}],"size":27,"enrolment":0},{"code":"T0110","instructors":[],"times":[{"day":"WEDNESDAY","start":16,"end":18,"duration":2,"location":"BA 2165"}],"size":27,"enrolment":0},{"code":"T0111","instructors":[],"times":[{"day":"TUESDAY","start":16,"end":18,"duration":2,"location":"BA 2195"}],"size":27,"enrolment":0},{"code":"T0112","instructors":[],"times":[{"day":"WEDNESDAY","start":16,"end":18,"duration":2,"location":"BA B024"}],"size":27,"enrolment":0}]}

Increasing global recognition of nature deficit disorder and the values of green infrastructure to mitigate broader human impacts gives a new meaning to the term 'urban forestry', coined here at UofT and now recognized widely. Trees in and around the city are key to providing multiple engineered and ecological services that only recently have been brought into the responsible fiscal planning of every municipality around the globe. If managed properly (a key concept), urban forests mitigate climate change and urban heat island effects, act as carbon sinks, air filters, water purifiers, air conditioners, noise dampeners, wildlife and/or biodiversity refuges, and green spaces for the human spirit.

There is virtually no area in Canada that escapes the influence of snow and ice. We skate on frozen ponds, ski down snow covered mountains, drive through snow blizzards and watch how ice jams in rivers cause rivers to swell and floods to occur. The duration and the thickness of snow and ice increase rapidly northwards, and glaciers are found in mountainous areas and in large parts of the Arctic region. Given that snow and ice impact heavily on the Canadian way of life, this course seeks to understand the dynamics of snow and ice in a hydrological context. This course will examine snow properties, snow cover distribution, glacier hydrology, melt runoff, and ice in its many forms (lake ice, river ice, sea ice, and ground ice). This course will also examine some of the recent observed changes occurring in the cryosphere regions of Canada. This course fulfills 2 field days.

The aftermath of crisis also witnessed mortgage foreclosures and evictions, factory closures, bailouts of large banks and hedge funds, and the implosion of public finances in a number of European nations. This course seeks to understand the spatial organization of financial flows, intermediaries, and instruments, and how these may be related to the apparently disparate phenomenon cited above. It explores how this geography of finance might be related to the production of financial crisis, and how the global geography of international finance relates to the public finances of nations and municipalities, pension and hedge funds, and individual investors. This course begins by exploring the workings of international finance, and examining the history of financial crisis, including both the current crisis and the great depression. We consider the different theories of financial crisis emanating from disparate political-economic-geographical perspectives, as well as the divergent policy implications that flow from such theories.

Due to the scope and complexity of this field, this course will not cover all physiological control systems but rather a selected few such as the neuromuscular, cardiovascular, and endocrine control systems. This course will also provide an introduction to the structures and mechanisms responsible for the proper functioning of these systems. This course will combine linear control theory, physiology, and neuroscience with the objective of explaining how these complex systems operate in a healthy human body. The first part of the course will provide an introduction into physiology and give an overview of the main physiological systems. The second part of the course will focus on the endocrine system and its subsystems, including glucose regulation, thyroid metabolic hormones, and the menstrual cycle. The third part of the course will include discussion on the cardiovascular system and related aspects such as cardiac output, venous return, control of blood flow by the tissues, and nervous regulation of circulation. The fourth and final section of the course will focus on the central nervous system, the musculoskeletal system, proprioception, kinaesthetic, and control of voluntary motion.","division":"Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering","department":"Mechanical & Industrial Engineering","prerequisites":"CHE353H1","exclusions":"","level":300,"campus":"UTSG","term":"2016 Winter","breadths":[],"meeting_sections":[{"code":"L0101","instructors":["J Zariffa"],"times":[{"day":"FRIDAY","start":9,"end":11,"duration":2,"location":"GB 221"},{"day":"WEDNESDAY","start":10,"end":11,"duration":1,"location":"GB 221"}],"size":90,"enrolment":0},{"code":"P0101","instructors":[],"times":[{"day":"MONDAY","start":18,"end":21,"duration":3,"location":"MB 325"}],"size":45,"enrolment":0},{"code":"P0102","instructors":[],"times":[{"day":"WEDNESDAY","start":18,"end":21,"duration":3,"location":"MB 325"}],"size":45,"enrolment":0},{"code":"P0103","instructors":[],"times":[{"day":"TUESDAY","start":18,"end":21,"duration":3,"location":"MB 325"}],"size":30,"enrolment":0},{"code":"T0101","instructors":[],"times":[{"day":"MONDAY","start":13,"end":14,"duration":1,"location":"BA 2145"}],"size":45,"enrolment":0},{"code":"T0102","instructors":[],"times":[{"day":"FRIDAY","start":14,"end":15,"duration":1,"location":"BA 2155"}],"size":45,"enrolment":0}]}

The second component of the course is a seminar component that meets once per week for 3 hours. Roughly 75% of the seminar will be devoted to more in-depth study of the topics taken up in the PHL105Y. You will write a seminar paper on one of these topics under the supervision of a UTM Philosophy faculty member working in the relevant area. You will also give an oral presentation on your topic to the seminar members. The remaining 25% of the seminar will focus on the methods and challenges of teaching philosophy, benchmark grading, and grading issues generally.

We will uncover the wonders of the classical and the quantum worlds courtesy of Galileo, Newton, Maxwell, Einstein, Heisenberg and many others.\r\n(PHY100H1 is primarily intended as a Breadth Requirement course for students in the Humanities and Social Science)","division":"Faculty of Arts and Science","department":"Physics","prerequisites":"","exclusions":"PHY131H1/PHY132H1/PHY151H1/PHY152H1 taken previously or concurrently","level":100,"campus":"UTSG","term":"2016 Summer F","breadths":[5],"meeting_sections":[{"code":"L0101","instructors":[],"times":[{"day":"MONDAY","start":14,"end":17,"duration":3,"location":"MP 202"},{"day":"WEDNESDAY","start":14,"end":17,"duration":3,"location":"MP 202"}],"size":196,"enrolment":0},{"code":"T0101","instructors":[],"times":[{"day":"MONDAY","start":17,"end":18,"duration":1,"location":"MP 118"}],"size":98,"enrolment":0},{"code":"T0201","instructors":[],"times":[{"day":"WEDNESDAY","start":17,"end":18,"duration":1,"location":"MP 118"}],"size":98,"enrolment":0}]}

But we can understand the Universe. That makes us something very special.\" The magic of Physics, with its ambitious goals of pushing the boundaries of knowledge, from finding the \"God particle\" to predicting the fate of the Universe, will be the focus of this course. The course is intended for those who are not trained in Physics and Mathematics but who nevertheless want to gain insight into this interesting and important field in a non-intimidating way. We will discover important concepts and theories through applications to everyday phenomena, including new energy sources, laser surgery, flat-screen TVs, wireless communications, GPS, etc. More advanced, but nevertheless fascinating and popular topics, will also be covered: time travel, relativity, ultracold atoms, quantum entanglement, black holes and the Higgs boson. No previous background in Physics is expected; high school algebra is recommended.

Then the dynamics of systems of particles is examined.","division":"Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering","department":"Division of Engineering Science","prerequisites":"","exclusions":"MIE100H1","level":100,"campus":"UTSG","term":"2015 Fall","breadths":[],"meeting_sections":[{"code":"L0101","instructors":["J Thywissen"],"times":[{"day":"MONDAY","start":12,"end":13,"duration":1,"location":"MP 202"},{"day":"TUESDAY","start":17,"end":18,"duration":1,"location":"MP 103"},{"day":"WEDNESDAY","start":12,"end":13,"duration":1,"location":"MP 202"}],"size":180,"enrolment":0},{"code":"L0102","instructors":["J Thywissen"],"times":[{"day":"MONDAY","start":15,"end":16,"duration":1,"location":"SF 1105"},{"day":"THURSDAY","start":15,"end":16,"duration":1,"location":"MP 202"},{"day":"WEDNESDAY","start":13,"end":14,"duration":1,"location":"MP 202"}],"size":180,"enrolment":0},{"code":"P0101","instructors":[],"times":[{"day":"TUESDAY","start":9,"end":12,"duration":3,"location":"MP 126"}],"size":45,"enrolment":0},{"code":"P0102","instructors":[],"times":[{"day":"TUESDAY","start":14,"end":17,"duration":3,"location":"MP 126"}],"size":45,"enrolment":0},{"code":"P0103","instructors":[],"times":[{"day":"WEDNESDAY","start":9,"end":12,"duration":3,"location":"MP 126"}],"size":45,"enrolment":0},{"code":"P0104","instructors":[],"times":[{"day":"FRIDAY","start":9,"end":12,"duration":3,"location":"MP 126"}],"size":45,"enrolment":0},{"code":"P0105","instructors":[],"times":[{"day":"TUESDAY","start":9,"end":12,"duration":3,"location":"MP 126"}],"size":45,"enrolment":0},{"code":"P0106","instructors":[],"times":[{"day":"TUESDAY","start":14,"end":17,"duration":3,"location":"MP 126"}],"size":45,"enrolment":0},{"code":"P0107","instructors":[],"times":[{"day":"WEDNESDAY","start":9,"end":12,"duration":3,"location":"MP 126"}],"size":45,"enrolment":0},{"code":"P0108","instructors":[],"times":[{"day":"FRIDAY","start":9,"end":12,"duration":3,"location":"MP 126"}],"size":45,"enrolment":0},{"code":"T0101","instructors":[],"times":[{"day":"WEDNESDAY","start":11,"end":12,"duration":1,"location":"HA 410"}],"size":30,"enrolment":0},{"code":"T0102","instructors":[],"times":[{"day":"WEDNESDAY","start":11,"end":12,"duration":1,"location":"BA 2185"}],"size":30,"enrolment":0},{"code":"T0103","instructors":[],"times":[{"day":"WEDNESDAY","start":11,"end":12,"duration":1,"location":"BA 2195"}],"size":30,"enrolment":0},{"code":"T0104","instructors":[],"times":[{"day":"WEDNESDAY","start":15,"end":16,"duration":1,"location":"BA 2175"}],"size":30,"enrolment":0},{"code":"T0105","instructors":[],"times":[{"day":"WEDNESDAY","start":15,"end":16,"duration":1,"location":"BA 2165"}],"size":30,"enrolment":0},{"code":"T0106","instructors":[],"times":[{"day":"WEDNESDAY","start":15,"end":16,"duration":1,"location":"BA 2155"}],"size":30,"enrolment":0},{"code":"T0107","instructors":[],"times":[{"day":"WEDNESDAY","start":14,"end":15,"duration":1,"location":"HA 410"}],"size":30,"enrolment":0},{"code":"T0108","instructors":[],"times":[{"day":"WEDNESDAY","start":14,"end":15,"duration":1,"location":"BA 2139"}],"size":30,"enrolment":0},{"code":"T0109","instructors":[],"times":[{"day":"WEDNESDAY","start":14,"end":15,"duration":1,"location":"HA 401"}],"size":30,"enrolment":0},{"code":"T0110","instructors":[],"times":[{"day":"WEDNESDAY","start":12,"end":13,"duration":1,"location":"HA 410"}],"size":30,"enrolment":0},{"code":"T0111","instructors":[],"times":[{"day":"WEDNESDAY","start":12,"end":13,"duration":1,"location":"BA 2139"}],"size":30,"enrolment":0},{"code":"T0112","instructors":[],"times":[{"day":"WEDNESDAY","start":12,"end":13,"duration":1,"location":"HA 401"}],"size":30,"enrolment":0}]}
