This process will lead to the preparation of project proposals consisting of identification of design objectives and constraints, generation and evaluation of potential approaches, selection of the most promising design concept, identification of product subsystems, and assignment of responsibilities to team members. Following project approval, the design process will comprise preliminary design, followed by detailed design, prototype construction and testing, and preparation of a final design report. Progress is evaluated weekly, culminating in a prototype demonstration and design review.","division":"Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering","department":"Division of Engineering Science","prerequisites":"","exclusions":"","level":200,"campus":"UTSG","term":"2017 Winter","breadths":[],"meeting_sections":[]}

Performance and mission specifications are given, as well as the engine’s characteristics. The class is divided into teams of three to four students who are guided to develop an airplane that can meet these specifications. Individual team members will specialize in areas such as “performance”, “structure”, “systems”, etc., although all team members should be conversant with each other’s results and methodology. Each week, a representative of each team presents a progress lecture on that team’s efforts, which is discussed and critiqued by the class. Also, the teams meet one-on-one with the professor and tutors to discuss specific design questions. At the end of the course each team will present a verbal and written report of sufficient detail to provide a compelling case for the feasibility of their proposed airplane.

South Asia is a place where many external cultural traditions mixed with indigenous traditions to create new socioeconomic and sociopolitical entities and sequences. While we will examine classic examples of hunter-gatherer groups, early villages, urban settlements, regional polities, and large empires through time, we will also stress the contemporaneity of groups of people with very different lifestyles -- hunter-gatherers participated in trading networks with town and city dwellers, pastoral nomads moved through settled village regions during their annual migrations. The impact of archaeological research on the region today is seen through the politicization of South Asian prehistory and history that has strongly affected both interpretations of the past and modern political events. Cases such as the debate over the identity of the Harappans and the existence of the Aryans will be evaluated from both an archaeological and a political perspective.
